# Section #1 - tools & technologies

### Goal
This section represents onboarding to the tools and technologies Softonix is used for building the projects. You need to understand how correctly chosen tools can speed up the development time. What is the proper way of using IDE, learn shortcuts, plugins and extensions. You will understand the skeleton for modern web development tooling: Node.js and itâ€™s package manager: NPM

### Tech plan
- IDE Workflow (Eslint, Volar and VSCode config)
- NPM
- ESLint
- Tech stack, base project intro

### Materials for the section
- Read Why VSCode? [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/whyvscode)
- Install VSCode IDE: [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install Node.js LTS: [link](https://nodejs.org/uk/download/)
- Read What is NPM? [link](https://www.impressivewebs.com/npm-for-beginners-a-guide-for-front-end-developers/)

### Section Playground
- Branch name: [`section-1-tooling`](https://github.com/Softonix/softonix-incubator/tree/section-1-tooling)
- Tag1: `#section-1-tooling-start`
    - Represent a clean application with ESLint installed with a config file.
    - JSON file for VSCode configuration
- Tag2: `#section-2-tooling-end`
    - Installed all extensions: Volar, ESlint, Vue Peek (Needed for later section: #5 Vue).
    - Install project packages and run the project: npm install & npm run dev
    - Updated configuration of VSCode based on config file.
    - Turned off built-in Typescript in VSCode.
    - JS Examples with bad and good linting. Showcased examples on how to format files using VSCode.
    - JS Examples with navigation across the different files and how IDE can help. Search in file, search file, rename variables, show `Go back / Go forward` examples.
